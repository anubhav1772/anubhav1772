My areas of interest include robotics, control systems, and reinforcement learning. Currently, I am working with physics simulation engines such as Isaac Gym, MuJoCo, and PyBullet as part of my ongoing research projects. In previous work, I have primarily used ROS and the Gazebo physics engine for robotic simulation and system integration.

My research interests focus on legged robotic systems, including quadrupeds and bipeds, with a particular emphasis on energy-efficient locomotion control, robust sim-to-real transfer, and adaptive behaviors that enable robots to operate reliably in diverse and dynamic environments.
