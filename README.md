My areas of interest include robotics, control systems, and reinforcement learning. Currently, I am working with physics simulation engines such as Isaac Gym, MuJoCo, and PyBullet as part of my ongoing research projects. In previous work, I have primarily used ROS and the Gazebo physics engine for robotic simulation and system integration.

My research interests particularly focus on legged robots, including quadrupeds and bipeds, with an emphasis on locomotion control, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptive behavior in dynamic environments.
